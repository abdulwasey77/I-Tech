SDDP SDK version 1.0d READ ME FIRST

This release of the Control4 SDDP Software Development Kit is versioned at 1.0a. The SDK version number is indicative of the development kit in its entirety. 
This SDK revision represents a minor enhancement/modification or issue resolution to the 1.0 version of the development kit. You will notice that 
the version of the SDDP protocol included within the SDK itself has not changed. It remains at 1.0. 

As the SDDP SDK evolves, Control4 may add enhancements and/or resolve issues and deliver these through a new SDDP SDK with a revised version number.  
These releases will use the following versioning scheme: 1.0b, 1.0c, 1.0d, etc. Throughout the delivery of these minor SDK releases, the version of the 
SDDP protocol within the SDK will remain at 1.0. This versioning scheme ensures SDDP compatibility across releases and also provides a means of differentiating
the software development kits.
